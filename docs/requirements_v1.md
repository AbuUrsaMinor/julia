# Julia Fractal Viewer - Requirements Document v1.0

## Overview
Julia is a web-based 3D fractal visualization application that allows users to explore and interact with Julia set fractals in three dimensions. The application features a retro-inspired user interface reminiscent of the 1980s demo scene aesthetic.

## Core Features

### 1. 3D Fractal Rendering
- Generate and display Julia set fractals in 3D
- Real-time rendering using WebGL
- Support for different Julia set parameters
- Smooth color transitions based on iteration count
- Multiple color palettes inspired by retro computing

### 2. Interactive Controls
- **Rotation**
  - Full 360-degree rotation on all axes
  - Smooth rotation animation
  - Mouse/touch drag support for rotation
  - Optional auto-rotation mode

- **Zoom**
  - Seamless zoom in/out capabilities
  - Mouse wheel / pinch-to-zoom support
  - Minimum and maximum zoom limits
  - Zoom animation with easing

### 3. Retro UI Design
- **Visual Style**
  - CRT screen effect overlay
  - Scanlines and phosphor glow effects
  - Neon color palette
  - Grid-based backgrounds
  - Low-resolution inspired pixelated elements

- **Typography**
  - Pixel/bitmap fonts
  - Text glitch effects
  - DOS/terminal-style text rendering

- **Interface Elements**
  - Wireframe UI components
  - Synthwave-inspired color gradients
  - 80's style button and control designs
  - Retro computing inspired icons

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Target 60 FPS on modern browsers
- Responsive rendering at various screen sizes
- Progressive loading for complex fractals
- Mobile device optimization

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge support
- WebGL 2.0 support required
- Touch device support
- PWA support for offline usage

### Accessibility
- Keyboard controls for all interactions
- High contrast mode option
- Screen reader compatibility
- Configurable animation speeds

## Future Considerations
- Parameter customization interface
- Fractal formula editor
- Screenshot/export functionality
- Preset system for saving favorite views
- Social sharing integration

## Success Metrics
- Smooth rendering performance (60 FPS)
- Intuitive rotation and zoom controls
- Authentic retro aesthetic
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile device usability
